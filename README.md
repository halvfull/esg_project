# DNB ESG Data Hub - Takehome Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains the prototype for analyzing DNB's Green Asset Ratio (GAR) as part of the takehome assignment. It includes a Python-based API for serving insights into DNB's GAR eligibility, as well as a simple front-end for visualizing data.

## File Descriptions

- `.gitignore` - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `LICENSE` - The license file for the project.
- `README.md` - Provides an overview and documentation for the project.
- `customer.py` - Defines the `Customer` Pydantic model for API request and response validation.
- `database.py` - Contains SQLAlchemy setup and session creation for database interactions.
- `gar_calc.py` - A Python script for calculating the Green Asset Ratio and related data processing tasks.
- `index.html` - A simple front-end HTML file for visualizing the plots generated by the API.
- `main.py` - The FastAPI application file that defines the API endpoints.
- `models.py` - SQLAlchemy ORM models that represent the database schema.
- `taxonomy.json` - The EU taxonomy data in JSON format.

## Setup and Running

1. Install the required libraries:
2. Start the FastAPI application:
